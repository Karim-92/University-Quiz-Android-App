# University quiz application
This is a university project that I worked on during the summer but couldn't complete due to time problems, as I had a couple of weeks to learn android programming
as well as make the app. The idea was that the app as to let a student login and take a quiz that the doctor has uploaded before from the website of the app.
The app has reached the initial design stages and it was working in terms of logging in a student and getting back a login session.
